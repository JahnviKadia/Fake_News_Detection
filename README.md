## This is a capstone project which was performed in the PG Certificate Program in Data Science and AI, IIT Roorkee.
### Fake News Detection
  1. ISOT Fake News Dection Dataset is used. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/Datasets/Emineyetm/Fake-news-detection-datasets
  2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering was performed on the dataset
  3. Following ML Models are trained:
       1. Logistic Regression
       2. Naive Bayes
       3. Random Forest
       4. Decision Tree
       5. SVM
       6. Voting Classifier
       7. Gradient Boosting Classifier
       8. XGBoost Classifier
       9. AdaBoost Classifier
  4. Evaluation Matrices:
       1. Precison
       2. Recall
       3. Accuracy
       4. F1 Score
       5. Confusion Matrix
